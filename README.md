## ü•ò Recipe app üç¥

‚ú®[Deployed version here](https://recipefilterapp.netlify.app/)‚ú®

Ever struggled figuring out what to cook for dinner? Well, so do I every day. So I thought it would be nice to create an app that can solve this issue by giving some inspiration. A user can search on recipes based on ingredients, flavour profile and other criteria. They can also add recipes themselves.

For future features take a look here:

## Goals for this project

- Apply what I learned during the Codaisseur bootcamp.
- Building a full-stack application.
- Showcase development approach by using wireframes, kanban board, UML database model and user stories.
- Practising github usage.
- Independent learning using documentation and other resources.

## User Stories

Currently implemented user stories:

- As a person looking for cooking inspiration, I want to be able to search with an ingredient that I have at home, so I don't need to buy more ingredients.
- As a person looking for cooking inspiration be able to filter the recipes based the type of meal, flavour profile and diet.
- As a logged in user I want to be able to create a recipe so I can share it with other users.
- As a person that is looking for cooking inspiration, I want to be able to get the full instructions on a recipe when I click on it so I can make it.

Future user stories I am planning on implementing:

- As a logged in user I want to be able to save my recipes to a list so I can easily find them.
- As a logged in user I want to be able to leave a note/stars on a recipe I tried so that in the future If I want to cook it again, I know what my thoughts on it were.
