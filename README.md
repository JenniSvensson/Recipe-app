## Recipe app

Ever struggled figuring out what to cook for dinner?, Well so do I every day. So I thought it would be nice to create an app that can solve this issue by giving some insperation. A user can search on recipes based on ingredients, flavour profile and other criteria. They can also add recipes themselves.

This project is still in development, for future functions look here:

## User Stories

As a person looking for cooking inspiration, I want to ...

- be able to search with a ingredient that I have at home so I don't need to buy more ingredients.
- be able to filter the recipes based the type of meal, flavour profile and diet.
